+ Project Summary: When it comes to investing, people are always on the lookout for new strategies to maxanize  their success. However, the actions investors take differ from person to person because of several factors, such as risk tolerance, income level, past experiences, and macroeconomic shifts. We can use machine learning for stock market analysis. Specifically, we will focus on PCA for market trend analysis and sparse PCA for portfolio selection. Since we emphasize portfolio diversification, we believe it to be a universally appealing method to all investors, regardless of their investing background. 

	+ Historical Trend Analysis: an interactive line plot detailing adjusted closing prices of selected stocks

	+ Market Analysis: a plot summarizing market trends of stocks using Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

	+ Portfolio Selection: a plot providing users recommendations on which stocks to invest in to reduce risk using sparse PCA

+ Target Audience: New investors can use this application to identify diverse stocks to start building their portfolios. Meanwhile, older investors can use this application to help identify correlated stocks in their existing portfolios. Both groups of investors would be able check back as often as they like and see how the correlations between their investments has changed oer time and adjust their portfolios as needed.
