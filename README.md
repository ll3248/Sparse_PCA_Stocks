+ The Data Incubator Winter 2021 Cohort Capstone Project

+ Levi Lee, MA of Statistics at Columbia University

+ Project Summary: When it comes to investing, people are always on the lookout for new strategies to maxanize  their success. However, the actions investors take differ from person to person because of several factors, such as risk tolerance, income level, past experiences, and macroeconomic shifts. We can use machine learning for stock market analysis. Specifically, we will focus on PCA for market trend analysis and sparse PCA for portfolio selection. Since we emphasize portfolio diversification, we believe it to be a universally appealing method to all investors, regardless of their investing background. 

	+ Historical Trend Analysis: an interactive line plot detailing adjusted closing prices of selected stocks

	+ Market Analysis: a plot summarizing market trends of stocks using Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

	+ Portfolio Selection: a plot providing users recommendations on which stocks to invest in to reduce risk using sparse PCA
